# Statistics Calculator

## Project Description
This project was created using the Vue.JS framework. The home page contains links to various statistics tools that can be used for a variety of calculations. I created this project because as a mathematics major, I have experience with statistics and I know that it is convenient to have a website with a variety of statistical tools all in one place. 

## Available Statistics Tools
### One-Variable Summary Statistics
Users can enter a comma-separated list of data and the following will be calculated and shown:
- Count
- Minimum
- Maximum
- Range
- Mean
- Variance
- Standard Deviation
### Z Score Calculator
Users enter an x value, the population mean, and the population standard deviation. The Z score will be calculated and shown, along with the area under the normal curve to the left and to the right of that Z score.
### Distribution of Sample Means Calculator
Users enter the sample mean, the population mean, the population standard deviation, and the sample size. The Z score will be calculated and shown, along with the area under the normal curve to the left and to the right of that Z score.
### T Score Calculator
Users enter the sample mean, the population mean, the sample standard deviation, and the sample size, and the corresponding T score will be calculated and shown, along with the area under the Student-T distribution to the left and to the right of that T score.
### Binomial Distribution
Users enter an x value (must be less than or equal to the sample size), a probability (between 0.0 and 1.0), and a sample size (or number of trials), and the following probabilities will be calculated and displayed:
- P(X = x)
- P(X <= x)
- P(X < x)
- P(X >= x)
- P(X > x)
### Poisson Distribution
Users enter an x value and the mean, and the following probabilities will be calculated and displayed:
- P(X = x)
- P(X <= x)
- P(X < x)
- P(X >= x)
- P(X > x)
### Geometric Distribution
Users enter an x value, select whether the random variable includes or does not include a success trial, and enter a probability. The corresponding probabilities are then calculated.
- P(X = x)
- P(X <= x)
- P(X < x)
- P(X >= x)
- P(X > x)
