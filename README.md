# statistics-calculator

I created this project using Vue.JS to provide a single location for a variety of statistical calculations. The available calculations are as follows:

- One-variable Summary Statistics
- Z Score Calculator
- Distribution of Sample Means Z Score Calculator
- T Score Calculator
- Probability Distributions:
    - Binomial Distribution
    - Poisson Distribution
    - Geometric Distribution

## One-variable Summary Statistics

Users enter data in the provided text field as a comma-separated list. This text input can only include numbers and commas. If another character is entered, an error will be displayed on the page.
